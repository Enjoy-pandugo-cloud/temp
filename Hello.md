## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

### 1.1 Purpose
TagAlong is a Hyderabad-specific ride-sharing application designed to connect everyday commuters traveling in the same direction. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services or bike taxis that rely on dedicated drivers, TagAlong enables peer-to-peer ride sharing, emphasizing two-wheelers while also supporting car rides when appropriate.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Daily commuters (office-goers, college students)
- Short-distance travelers within Hyderabad
- Budget-conscious riders
- Environmentally conscious individuals looking to reduce traffic congestion and carbon footprint

### 1.3 Value Proposition
- Cost sharing between commuters
- Reduction in empty vehicle capacity
- Decreased traffic congestion
- Lower environmental impact
- Community building among regular commuters

---

## 2. System Overview <a name="system-overview"></a>

### 2.1 Concept
TagAlong connects people who are already planning to travel on a particular route with others who need to go in the same direction. The application prioritizes two-wheelers (bikes/scooters) for quick city travel but also supports car ride-sharing for longer distances or when more passengers are involved.

### 2.2 Core Philosophy
- **Not a commercial taxi service**: Users are everyday commuters sharing costs, not professional drivers
- **Bike-first approach**: Emphasis on two-wheelers as they're more common and efficient in Hyderabad traffic
- **Trust and safety**: Robust verification and rating systems to ensure user safety
- **Cost sharing**: Fair calculation of expenses rather than profit-driven pricing

### 2.3 Constraints & Limitations
- Users must have their own vehicle to offer rides
- Limited to Hyderabad city limits (with potential for expansion)
- Requires internet connectivity for real-time features
- Only supports two-wheelers and cars (no autos, trucks, or other vehicle types)
